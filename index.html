		<h1>TAFSEER OF THIS SURAH</h1>

		<p style="border-radius: 0;">
			This Surah was revealed when Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) was mocked and mentally tortured by Quraysh 
			upon death of his 2 sons. According to Narration Prophet’s (PBUH) sons Qasim and Abdullah died in infancy and 
			this gave Quraysh a chance to torture him mentally and mock him.
			<br><br>Ikrimah, Aas bin Wa’il and Abu Lahab started mocking Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) by calling him ‘Abtar’ (Cut-off) they said:
			“His line has come to an end: now he is Abtar”
			This trend was followed by Uqba bin Abi Muit, Abu Jahal and other wicked Makkans and they started 
			propagating that Prophet (PBUH) had no more male descendants which is why he is cutoff and there will be no 
			one who would carry his message and religion. His death will mean the death of his message and end of story 
			of Islam.
			<br><br>This propaganda was so strong and powerful that despite trying his level best to ignore, Prophet (PBUH) got 
			anxious and depressed. Poisonous words of Makkans mixed with the pain of losing 2 sons in a very short time 
			span was not an easy experience. They even started showing pity and mercy as Aas bin Wa’il used to say:
			“Let this childless man be alone. When he dies there will be no one to carry his name.”
			<br><br>Allah revealed Surah Al-Kauthar to console Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and promised him that his enemy will 
			be cut off and there will be uncountable followers and message bearers of Islam. As Allah is the best Planner 
			and Disposer of events, same thing happened as we can see millions of people who proudly associate 
			themselves with Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) but no one who would remember wicked Makkans.
			<br><br>As a perk, Allah blessed Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) with Abundance which is a complete package of gifts that 
			include guidance, support, success in this world and in hereafter, matchless designation and a stream of 
			paradise.
			<br><br>
			<b>Note</b> <br>
			Imagine how Allah has raised the name of the Holy Prophet ﷺ and exalted his reputation in every nook and corner of the world since the inception of his prophet-hood till today, and it will continue to be so until the end of time. His blessed name is recited along with Allah's name five times a day from the minarets. In the Hereafter, he will be granted the (Al-Maqam Al-Mahmud) Praised Station where he will make the Grand Intercession on behalf of the entire progeny of 'Adam (AS) . On the contrary, ask the world history: Where are the children of ` As Ibn Wa'il? Where are the children of Ka'b Ibn Ashraf? where are the children of 'Uqbah, and what happened to their families? Their very own names have been lost to the world. No one cares to remember them. They have become unknown who thought that soon the Holy Prophet ﷺ will become unknown. They have left this world and the strings of their lineage have been cut off.
